# ReactEmployee

This is very basic example in using React JS where I created Employee list using the fundamental of react native (state, props, etc) and some javascript array function (filter, map) to processing employee list I created in json file.

If you want to run it, first use npm install on command prompt, and then using npm start to deploy the web on your localhost:3000.
